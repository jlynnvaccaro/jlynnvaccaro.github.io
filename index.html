<p>I am a fifth year graduate student in the UIC <a href="http://www.math.uic.edu/">
    Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science</a>, studying hyperbolic geometry and Anosov representations with advisor <a href="https://www.dumas.io/">Emily Dumas</a>. </p>
<p>Outside of math, I love to hike, write music, and play soccer. I'm also involved with our graduate workers' union, <a href='https://www.uicgeo.org/'>UIC GEO</a>.</p>

<h2>Research and Pictures</h2>
<p>I am interested in hyperbolic geometry and Anosov representations into Lie groups. I also enjoy visualizing mathematics using software. My research has been supported by NSF grants during several summers and semesters throughout graduate school.</p>
<!-- <p>My CV can be found <a href="VACCARO_JENNIFER.pdf">here</a>.</p> -->

<p>Here are pictures of some ideas that I have been thinking about recently. They were created with <a href="http://draw.io/">Draw IO</a> or with <a href='https://matplotlib.org/'>Matplotlib</a>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Hyperconvex limit curves: For hyperconvex representations, the projection of the limit curve is injective. As we perturb the T(3,5,5) representation in the SL(3,C) character variety towards the Anosov boundary, this projected limit curve appears to remain injective. </li>

        <li>Visualizations of the C-Hitchin component for T(3,4,4), T(3,4,5), and T(3,5,5) representations in SL(3,C). Black means "likely Anosov" and lighter colors mean "not Anosov." See these <a href="VACCAROJ_Palermo_slides.pdf">slides</a> for more context.</li>

        <li>Triangle reflection groups act on H^2 by isometries with fundamental domain a 2-orbifold triangle. Though these groups have torsion, they still admit nice representations into Lie groups.</li>

        <li>In ALE hydrodynamics remap, you can compute the mass flux through a swept region in several equivalent ways.</li>
        <img src='SINUM.png' alt="Swept region equivalent integrals" width="800">
        <li>The colored squares are integer matrices related to the Bruhat order on A_3, which is the symmetric group on four letters.</li>
